The loading and unloading of cargo is a very "real-world" problem and one that is a potentially combinatorial explosive with the extremely large number of variables and configuration spaces needed to be considered even for a medium-sized container.

With the large number of variables that need to be fine tuned and the number of possible stowage configurational space that needs to be sampled even for a medium sized cargo ship, there is no way to ensure that a single optimal solution can be found in a reasonable processing time.

Problems such as this thus become highly suitable for automation techniques via the application of AI (Artificial Intelligence). In this specific instance, we chose to use Genetic Algorithms as a method of choice because the problem consists of a
1) Large set of candidate solutions
2) search space is uneven and has many hills and valleys
